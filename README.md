# quantization-notes
Trying quantization alongside learning theory of it.
This repositiory contrains code samples of quantization in PyTorch.
It has one neural network which we are traying to quantize and mesure the impact on accuracy.
This repo has implementations of 2 types of quantization.
1. Quantization Aware Training(QAT).
2. Post Quantization Training(PQT).
